1) Overview of problem statement/motivation for project
2) Data collection
  A) Sources of data
  B) Methods of collection
3) Data cleaning
  A) Formatting for merging
  B) Dropping sparse columns
    i) discuss need for new weather data
    ii) missing a lot of predictors we originally thought we had
  C) Dealing with missing data
  D) Checking for data quality
  E) Rescale the predictors/response as necessary 
      *** we should do this. see p. 103 of textbook ***
  F) Choosing subset of data to enable us to work within R
4) Diagnostics on model
  A) Checking error assumptions of the model
    i) Constant variance
    ii) Normality
    iii) Correlated errors
  B) Finding unusual observations within the model
    i) Leverage
    ii) Outliers
    iii) Influential observations
  C) Finding problems in the predictors
    i) Collinearity
  D) Checking the model's structure
5) Model selection
  A) stepwise selection (discuss why we didn't use it)
  B) forward/backward selection
  C) criterion-based procedures
6) Transformations
  A) Box-cox to determine transformation on the response
  B) Polynomial terms for predictors
  C) Additive models
7) Final model
8) Future research/problems
  A) Additional predictors
  B) Additional scope (example: time, global)
  C) Nonlinear models
    i) Additive models, etc.

When the errors are dependent, we can use *generalized least squares (GLS)*. 
When the errors are not normally distributed, we can use *robust regression*.
